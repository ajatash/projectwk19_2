* To protect an individual's privacy hospitalizations and ED visit counts from 1 to 5 are suppressed if the underlying population is less than or equal to 100000.
UR = Unstable Rate. Rates based on numerators less than or equal to 20 may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution.
** Person-years is equal to the sum of the population for each year.
***Age-adjusted rates can only be calculated for "All ages combined".
Hospitalizations data do not include data from federal and sovereign hospitals (e.g. Veteran's Administration; Indian Health Service) or data on Minnesota residents seen in facilities outside of Minnesota and North Dakota.
